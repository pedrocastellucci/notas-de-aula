You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-09-08T19:10:18.458788811Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

O custo de viajar de uma cidade $i$ para uma cidade $j$ é $c_{ij}$, $i, j = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1$. O problema de determinar uma rota com o menor custo que visita todas as cidades exatamente uma vez é conhecido como [[Problema do Caixeiro Viajante]].\n\n## Uma solução com enumeração explícita\n\nSolução baseada na permutação da lista de cidades $(0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N-1)$. É possível encontrar uma solução gerando todas as permutações da lista de cidades.\n\nPor exemplo, se $N = 4$ basta avaliar todas as sequências $(N-1)! = 6$  sequências e escolher a de menor custo.\n1.  $(0, 1, 2, 3)$\t\n2.  $(0, 1, 3, 2)$\n3.  $(0, 2, 1, 3)$\n4.  $(0, 2, 3, 1)$\n5.  $(0, 3, 1, 2)$\n6.  $(0, 3, 2, 1)$\n\nA relação de recorrência para gerar as permutações de uma sequência $S = (0, 1, \\ldots, N-1)$ de tamanho $N$ é dada por \n\n$$S_N = \\bigcup_{i \\notin S_{N-1}} \\Big\\{S_{N-1} | i \\Big\\}$$\n### Implementação utilizando [[Backtracking]]\n\nPode-se realizar uma numeração explícita da todas as permutações da sequência $S = (0, 1, \\ldots, N-1)$, computar o custo de cada uma delas, identificando, assim uma solução ótima. Para isso, pode-se utilizar o código a seguir.\n\n```python\ndef backtrack(sol, left, N, best=INFINITY, opt=None):\n    if left == N:\n        cost = sol.get_value()\n        if cost \u003c best:\n            best = cost\n            opt = deepcopy(sol)\n    else:\n\t\tfor i in range(left, N):\n\t\t\tsol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]           \n\t\t\tbest, opt = backtrack(sol, left+1, N, best, opt)\n\t\t\tsol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]\n    return best, opt\n```\n\n### Alguns testes\n\nForam gerados $N$ pontos aleatórios em uma área 100 x 100. O tempo computacional para se encontrar uma solução ótima do [[Problema do Caixeiro Viajante]] para esses pontos é apresentado na tabela a seguir, para diferentes valores de $N$.\n\n| $N$   | Tempo (s) |\n| --- | --------- |\n| 5   | 0.001     |\n| 6   | 0.003     |\n| 7   | 0.006     |\n| 8   | 0.030     |\n| 9   | 0.213     |\n| 10  | 1.999     |\n| 11  | 21.636    |\n| 12  | 312.102   |\n\n### Análise do algoritmo\n\nO algoritmo enumera todas as $(N-1)!$ soluções viáveis para o problema e compara o custo da solução atual com a melhor encontrada até o momento. Portanto, o tempo computacional do algoritmo é de complexidade $O(N!)$.\n\nMelhorar as configurações de hardware ou utilizar uma linguagem como C/C++ poderia aumentar o tamanho dos problemas resolvidos no mesmo tempo computacional?\n\n#### Em um mundo mais rápido\n\nConforme o número de cidades $N$ aumenta, o número de soluções também aumenta\n\n| $N$     | Tempo (s)            |\n| ----- | -------------------- |\n| $5$   | $24$                 |\n| $10$  | $362880$             |\n| $20$  | $1\\,2 \\cdot 10^{17}$ |\n| $100$ | $\\approx 10^{156}$   |\n\nConsiderando um computador que consiga avaliar (computar o custo) de uma solução em $10^{-34}s$, seriam necessários $$\\approx 10^{122}s.$$ Mas a idade do universo é da ordem de $10^{17}s$ (e contando...).\n\n\u003e A [Constante de Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) foi a menor constante física que eu consegui encontrar e tem valor da ordem de $10^{-34}$, expresso em unidades do Sistema Internacional.\n\nPortanto, uma solução é investir em algoritmo que evitem enumerar todas as soluções explicitamente. \n\n## Uma enumeração ímplicita\n\nNa verdade, não é necessário explorar todas as soluções explicitamente. Note que o algoritmo proposto adiciona uma cidade a cada chamada da função, ou seja, em qualquer chamada da função em que a condição $left == N$ não é verdadeira, existe uma solução parcial definida $p = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_i), i \u003c N-1$. É possível calcular o custo de uma solução parcial $$c(p) = \\sum_{j=0}^{i-1} c_{j, j+1}.$$\nSe a solução parcial $p$ tiver um custo, $c(p)$, maior ou igual ao da melhor solução completa encontrada até o momento, não é necessário continuar explorando o ramo atual da árvore.  Por quê? Com essa modificação, há garantia de que uma solução ótima será encontrada? \n\nEssa estratégia de poda da árvore é conhecida como poda por qualidade. \n\n### Implementação com poda por qualidade\n\n```python\ndef backtrack(sol, left, N, best=INFINITY, opt=None):\n    if left == N:\n        cost = sol.get_value()\n        if cost \u003c best:\n            best = cost\n            opt = deepcopy(sol)\n    else:\n        cur_value = sol.get_value(0, left)\n        if cur_value \u003c best:\n            for i in range(left, N):\n                sol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]           \n                best, opt = backtrack(sol, left+1, N, best, opt)\n                sol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]\n    return best, opt\n```\n\nCom a poda por qualidade baseada no custo das soluções parciais é possível resolver problemas de dimensões maiores em tempo computacional similar.\n\n| $N$   | Tempo (s) |\n| --- | --------- |\n| 5   | 0.002     |\n| 6   | 0.003     |\n| 7   | 0.005     |\n| 8   | 0.009     |\n| 9   | 0.029     |\n| 10  | 0.097     |\n| 11  | 0.843     |\n| 12  | 4.303     |\n| 13  | 24.263    |\n| 14  | 61.984    |\n| 15  | 325.719   |\n\n\n### [[Algoritmos de branch-and-bound]], utilizando um [[limitante inferior]]\n\nÉ possível utilizar uma poda que inclui informações otimistas sobre o custo a ser atingido caso se continue explorando determinado ramo da árvore.  Uma opção é utilizar a [[Problema da Árvore Geradora Mínima|Árvore Geradora Mínima]] dos nós que ainda não foram visitados pela solução parcial atual. \n\nNote que o custo de uma [[Problema da Árvore Geradora Mínima|Árvore Geradora Mínima]] considerando os $N$ nós é um limitante inferior (otimista) para o custo de uma solução do [[Problema do Caixeiro Viajante]] com os mesmo $N$ nós. \n\n- Seja $t$ um tour no grafo $G$. A remoção de uma aresta de $G$ produz um caminho $r$. Como os custos das arestas são não negativos, tem-se $c(r) \\leq c(t)$. Como um caminho é também uma árvore, tem-se que o custo da Árvore Geradora Mínima (MST) é tal que $$c(MST) \\leq c(r) \\leq c(t).$$\n\nIsso possibilita que a operação de poda inclua informações sobre a solução de um [[Problema da Árvore Geradora Mínima]] para eliminar ramos da árvore que não forneçam soluções melhores do que a atual. \n\n\u003e Seja $z$ o valor da melhor solução conhecida até o momento, $P = (a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_i), i \u003c N,$ a solução parcial para o [[Problema do Caixeiro Viajante]] e $T$ uma [[Problema da Árvore Geradora Mínima|Árvore Geradora Mínima]] contemplando todos os nós não visitados na solução atual, $j \\notin P$. Então,  se $c(P) + c(T) \\geq z$ pode-se podar o ramo atual da árvore (não é necessário explorar a solução parcial $P$).  Por quê? #pergunta\n\nPara utilizar o limitante baseado na [[Problema da Árvore Geradora Mínima|Árvore Geradora Mínima]] pode-se modificar a implementação como feito a seguir. \n\n```python\ndef backtrack(sol, left, N, best=INFINITY, opt=None):\n    if left == N:\n        cost = sol.get_value()\n        if cost \u003c best:\n            best = cost\n            opt = deepcopy(sol)\n    else:\n        cur_value = sol.get_value(0, left)\n        bound_value = get_mst_cost(sol.tour[left+1:], sol.dist)\n        if cur_value + bound_value \u003c best:\n            for i in range(left, N):\n                sol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]           \n                best, opt = backtrack(sol, left+1, N, best, opt)\n                sol.tour[left], sol.tour[i] = sol.tour[i], sol.tour[left]\n    return best, opt\n```\n\nCom isso, executando algumas instâncias, obteve-se o seguinte resultado\n\n| N   | Tempo (s) |\n| --- | --------- |\n| 5   | 0.005     |\n| 6   | 0.007     |\n| 7   | 0.014     |\n| 8   | 0.021     |\n| 9   | 0.047     |\n| 10  | 0.095     |\n| 11  | 0.436     |\n| 12  | 0.854     |\n| 13  | 2.339     |\n| 14  | 4.523     |\n| 15  | 6.849     |\n| 16  | 13.905    |\n| 17  | 24.966    |\n| 18  | 31.602    |\n| 19  | 34.846    |\n| 20  | 121.833   |\n| 21  | 238.015   |\n| 22  | 367.061   |\n\n\nQuando se tem uma estratégia para conseguir um limitante otimista (inferior no caso de problemas de minimização e superior no caso de problemas de minimização), pode-se desenvolver um algoritmo de [[Algoritmos de branch-and-bound|Branch-and-bound]]. \n\n## Algumas conclusões\n\n- Para resolver esse problema (e outros NP-difíceis) é necessário lidar com o crescimento exponencial do espaço de soluções. \n- O que fazer a cada novo problema encontrado?\n\t- Criar um algoritmo de enumeração explícita \n\t- Encontrar propriedades que permitam a poda\n\t\t- Poda por qualidade\n\t\t- Poda por infactibilidade\n\t- Encontrar problemas auxiliares que forneçam bons limitantes inferiores\n- Existe um arcabouço que já possui todas essas \"funcionalidades\". Inclusive com pacotes computacionais com toda a ideia de [[Algoritmos de branch-and-bound]] (e diversas outras) já implementada, sendo necessário, apenas, fornecer os dados de entrada. Para aprendermos a utilizar tais ferramentas, precisamos aprender [[Programação Linear Inteira Mista]].\n\n# Referências\n\n- [Land, Ailsa H., and Alison G. Doig.

Deixa de atender pelo menos uma restrição do problema.\n\n## Um primeiro exemplo: O [[Problema da mochila]]\n\n### O [[Problema da mochila]]\n\n\u003e No Problema da mochila, há uma mochila com capacidade $C$ e $n$ tipos de items, cada tipo item $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ possui um peso e um valor $w_i$ e um valor, respectivamente. Qual é a quantidade de cada tipo de item que deve ser colocada na mochila de forma a maximizar o valore carregado, sem ultrapassar a capacidade da mochila?\n\nPara elaborar um modelo é necessário definir quais são as variáveis do problema. Uma primeira tentativa é observar quais são as decisões a serem tomadas. Nesse caso, isso é suficiente para definir as variáveis:\n\n- $x_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}⁺$: A quantidade de itens do tipo $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}$ a serem carregadas na mochila. \n\nPara a construção do modelo é necessário escrever duas informações utilizando as variáveis e os parâmetros do problema: \n- O peso do conjunto de itens escolhidos.\n\t- Note que a expressão $w_1 x_1$ define o peso total dos itens de tipo $1$ escolhidos. Portanto\n\t- A expressão $w_1 x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\ldots + w_nx_n$ compute o peso total dos itens escolhidos. A expressão pode ser escrita concisamente como $$\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i$$\n- O valor do conjunto de itens escolhidos.\n\t- Com um racicínio análogo ao feito para o peso dos itens, tem-se: $$\\sum_{i=1}^nv_ix_i$$\n\nCom isso, a função objetivo do problema pode ser escrita como $$\\max \\sum_{i=1}^n v_ix_i$$ sujeito as restrições $$\\sum_{i=1}^nw_ix_i \\leq C,$$ $$x \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+.$$\n\nExemplos de implementações podem ser visto [[Problema da mochila#^091f1b]].\n\n## Artifícios de modelagem\n\n### Modelando relações lógicas com variáveis\n\nConsidere uma situação em que há um conjunto $S$ e a cada item do conjunto está associada uma variável binária $x_i, i \\in S$. Semelhante ao [[Problema da mochila]]. Algumas situações frequentes em modelagem são exemplificadas a seguir.\n\n#### No máximo $N$ elementos\n\nCaso seja necessário que no máximo $N$ elementos do conjunto sejam selecionados:\n\n$$\\sum_{i \\in S} x_i \\leq N.$$\n\n#### Pelo menos $N$ elementos\n\nCaso seja necessário que no máximo $N$ elementos do conjunto sejam selecionados:\n\n$$\\sum_{i \\in S} x_i \\geq N.$$\n\n#### Exatamente $N$ elementos\n\nCaso seja necessário que exatamente $N$ elementos do conjunto sejam selecionados:\n\n$$\\sum_{i \\in S} x_i = N.$$\n\nEssa situação é análoga a um ou-exclusivo entre duas variáveis  $x_1 + x_2 = 1$\n\n#### Se ... então... ($a \\Rightarrow b$)\n\nConsidere duas variáveis binárias $x_a, x_b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ e que se deseja modelar a situação em que $x_a = 1 \\Rightarrow x_b = 1$. Por exemplo, há situações em que a escolha de um item do conjunto implica na escolha de outro (do mesmo ou de outro conjunto). Isto é, se $x_a = 1$ então $x_b = 1$, $a, b \\in S$.\n\n$$x_a \\leq x_b.$$\n\n- Considerando $x_a, x_b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Como modelar as seguintes situações? #pergunta \n\t- $x_a = 0 \\Rightarrow x_b = 0$\n\t- $x_a = 1 \\Rightarrow x_b = 0$\n\t- $x_a = 0 \\Rightarrow x_b = 1$\n\t- $x_a = 0 \\Leftrightarrow x_b = 0$\n\t\n\nOutra situação frequente é envolvendo uma variável binária $x_a \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, um valor $L \\geq 0$ e uma variável continua $y \\geq 0$, tal que $$x_a = 1 \\Rightarrow y \\geq L.$$  Para modelar tal situação é possível utilizar a restrição $$L x_a \\leq y.$$ Um raciocínio similar é utilizado no [[Problema de bin packing]].\n\n#### Um exemplo\n\nUma empresa está considerando expandir suas operações para dois novos estados $A$ e $B$. Também, está considerando construir no máximo um novo depósito, mas a localização do depósito é restrita à localização da nova fábrica. O capital disponível é de 10 milhões. Os demais valores relacionados a tais escolhas é apresentado a seguir.\n\nPara modelar o problema com o paradigma de Programação Inteira, considere as variáveis binárias\n\n$$x_j = \\begin{cases}1\\quad \\mbox{se a decis\\~{a}o $j$ é sim},\\\\ \n0\\quad \\mbox{caso contrário},\\end{cases}\\quad (j = 1, 2, 3, 4).$$\n\n| Decisão                    | Variável | Retorno previsto (R\\$) | Investimento necessário (R\\$)| \n| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |\n| Construir fábrica em $A$?  | $x_1$             |     9 milhões             | 6 milhões                        |\n| Construir fábrica em $B$?  | $x_2$         |     5 milhões             | 3 milhões                        |\n| Construir depósito em $A$? | $x_3$         |   6 milhões               | 5 milhões                        |\n| Construir depósito em $B$? | $x_4$     |    4 milhões              | 2 milhões                        |\n\n- Seja $Z$ o retorno previsto por cada decisão. O retorno total em milhões de dólares.\n\t-\t$$Z = 9x_1 + 5x_2 + 6x_3 + 4x_4.$$\n- Como o capital disponível é de 10 milhões, uma restrição do modelo é \n\t- $$6x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 + 2x_4 \\leq 10.$$\n- No máximo um depósito será construído:\n\t- $$x_3 + x_4 \\leq 1.$$\n- Depósitos são só construídos se uma fábrica também for.\n\t- $$x_3 \\leq x_1.$$\n\t- $$x_4 \\leq x_2.$$\n\nO modelo completo é dado por:\n\n$$\\max Z = 9x_1 + 5x_2 + 6x_3 + 4x_4$$\n \n sujeito a\n\n$$6x_1 + 3x_2 + 5x_3 + 2x_4 \\leq 10.$$\n$$x_3 + x_4 \\leq 1.$$\n$$x_3 \\leq x_1.$$\n$$x_4 \\leq x_2.$$\n$$x_j \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad j = 1, 2, 3, 4$$\n\n\nEste exemplo foi adaptado de [[2014Hillier_IntroductionToOperationsResearch|Hillier e Lieberman (2014)]].\nO exemplo é um tipo de [[Problema de localização de facilidades]].\n\n\n### Pelo menos uma restrição atendida\n\nConsidere duas restrições como as a seguir\n\n$$\\begin{cases}2x_1 + 3x_2 \\leq 20,\\\\ 5x_1 + 2x_2 \\leq 18.\\end{cases}$$\n\nDeseja-se que pelo menos uma dessas restrições seja atendida, mas não necessariamente ambas. \n\nUma forma de realizar isso é utilizar uma variável auxiliar $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\n$$y = \\begin{cases}0, \\mbox{ se $2x_1 + 3x_2 \\leq 20$ é atendida } \\\\ 1, \\mbox{ se $5x_1 + 2x_2 \\leq 18$ é atendida } \\\\\\end{cases}$$\n\nEntão, seja $M$ um número grande, podemos modelar a situação como:\n\n$$\\begin{cases}2x_1 + 3x_2 \\leq 20 + My,\\\\ 5x_1 + 2x_2 \\leq 18 + M(1 - y).\\end{cases}$$\n\nEssa técnica é útil, por exemplo, para modelos do [[Problema de corte e empacotamento]].\n\n### $K$ de $T$ restrições atendidas\n\nA ideia anterior pode ser adaptada para atender $K$ de um conjunto com $T$ restrições.

Para isso, seja $y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}, i=1, \\ldots, T$, que recebe valor $0$ se a $i$-ésima restrição é atendida. \n\nEntão, pode-se escrever\n\n$$a_{11}x_{1} + \\ldots + a_{1n}x_n \\leq b_1 + My_1,$$\n$$a_{21}x_{1} + \\ldots + a_{2n}x_n \\leq b_2 + My_2,$$\n$$\\vdots$$\n$$a_{T1}x_{1} + \\ldots + a_{Tn}x_n \\leq b_M + My_2,$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^Ty_i = T - K$$\n\n\n### Custo fixo\n\nO custo fixo ocorre quando há um custo inicial para um atividade. Por exemplo, o setup de uma atividade e o início de uma corrida de aplicativo. \n\nComo exemplo, considere que foi feito um pedido para um aplicativo de transporte, o custo por quilômetro de viagem é de $c$, mas é pago um custo fixo, ao início da corrida de $k$.

Existem alguns tipos de problemas diferentes: \n\n1. Encontrar uma solução satisfazendo um conjunto de restrições.\n2. Encontrar todas as soluções satisfazendo um conjunto de restrições.\n3. Encontrar uma solução ótima de acordo com uma função objetivo. \n\nProblemas de Otimização Combinatória são problemas combinatórios que potencialmente admitem mais de uma solução e essas soluções são diferenciadas por uma medida de qualidade, a função objetivo. \n\nDiversos problemas de otimização combinatória são NP-difíceis. Simplificadamente, isso faz com que o tempo de resolução cresça exponencialmente com o tamanho do problema. Por isso, algoritmos baseados na enumeração explícita de cada solução viável conseguem resolver apenas instâncias pequenas de tais problemas. Por isso, frequentemente, instâncias de interesse prático, demandam por estratégias mais sofisticadas de solução. \n\nDuas dessas estratégias são: métodos exatos e métodos heurísticos. Os métodos exatos, como o branch-and-cut, são métodos que garantem a otimalidade da solução encontrada desde que uma demanda por recursos computacionais (tempo e memória) possa ser atendida. Métodos heurísticos são métodos que relaxam a busca por soluções ótimas em prol da obtenção de uma solução boa em tempo computacional reduzido.\n\n![[attachments/Pasted image 20220908151703.png]]\n\nDentre os métodos exatos está o arcabouço conhecido como [[Branch-and-cut||branch-and-cut]]. A implementação de algoritmos de [[vault/Otimização/Branch-and-cut|branch-and-cut]] para um problema costuma ser não trivial. Para garantir a eficiência de tais algoritmos é necessário combinar estratégias de pré-processamento, exploração de árvores de branch-and-bound, planos de corte, entre outros. Nesse caso, é necessário construir problemas auxiliares para a obtenção de limitantes duais para o problema a ser resolvido. O arcabouço de branch-and-cut é de tamanha importância que há diversos pacotes computacionais que fornecem uma implementação pronta como [[Gurobi]], [[SCIP]], [[CPlex]] e [[Cbc]]. Para utilizar tais pacotes é necessário conseguir escrever o problema utilizando o paradigma de [[vault/Otimização/Modelagem para programas lineares inteiros|Programação Linear e Inteira]]. \n\nMétodos de solução heurísticos relaxam a garantia de otimalidade da solução em prol de reduzir os recursos computacionais necessários, em geral, deseja-se obter uma solução de boa qualidade (não necessariamente ótima) mais rapidamente. Existem diversas estratégias heurísticas, meta-heurísticas, que podem ser aplicadas a inúmeros problemas. Entre eles estão [[algoritmos genéticos]], [[algoritmos de colônias de formigas]], [[otimização por enxame de particulas]], [[busca tabu]], [[simulated annealing]], [[iterated local search]], [[variable neighborhood search]],  e muitos outros.","lastmodified":"2022-09-08T19:10:18.5507887Z","tags":null},"/vault/Otimiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o/Problema-do-Caixeiro-Viajante":{"title":"O problema do caixeiro viajante","content":"\n# \n# O Problema do Caixeiro Viajante\n\nUm vendedor deseja visitar as cidades $0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n-1$, partindo de uma delas.

A descrição do método que vamos estudar é substancialmente diferente do utilizado originalmente por Newton. A primeira publicação desse método é datada de 1685. Em 1690, [Joseph Raphson ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Raphson), publicou uma descrição simplificado. Por isso, o método é muitas vezes chamado de Método de Newton-Raphson. Newton e Raphson aplicaram o método exclusivamente para polinômios, foi apenas em 1740 que [Thomas Simpson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Simpson) descreveu o método como um método iterativo para resolver equações não lineares usando [[Cálculo]]. Essencialmente, essa é a descrição que será apresentada aqui.\n\n## Descrição do método\n\nO método de Newton pode ser utilizado para resolver equações $f(x) = 0$, $f: \\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$. Por enquanto, vamos nos concentrar no caso em que $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$. Note que encontrar uma raiz para equação $f(x) = 0$ é equivalente a encontrar um zero da função $f(x)$.\n\nConsidere o polinômio $$P(x) = x^5 + x^2 - 1$$\nCujo o gráfico é dado a seguir:\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ilgfeuouji?embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" frameborder=0\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nPara encontrar uma raiz da equação $P(x) = 0$, a ideia do método é produzir uma aproximação inicial para $x_0$ para tal raiz. Por exemplo, $x_0 = 1$. \n\nNo ponto $(x_0, P(x_0)) = (1, 1)$ utiliza-se uma aproximação linear para $P(x)$. Isto é, traça-se a reta $r(x)$ tangente a $P(x)$ em $x_0$. A reta é dada por:\n\n$$r(x) = P(x_0) + P'(x_0)(x - x_0),$$\nou seja,  $r(x) = 1 + 7(x - 1)$.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6icuole2bi?embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" frameborder=0\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nA próxima aproximação para a raiz de $P(x) = 0$ é dada pelo valor $x_1$ que correspondente ao ponto em que a reta $r(x)$ se encontra com o eixo horizontal. Então, é necessário encontrar o valor de $\\Delta x= x_1 - x_0$. Note que $\\frac{P(x_0)}{-\\Delta x} = P'(x_0)$ e tem-se:\n\n$$- \\Delta x = \\frac{P(x_0)}{P'(x_0)} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{P(x_0)}{P'(x_0)}.$$\nEntão, pode-se repetir o processo para gerar uma sequência de aproximações $(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots)$ para uma raiz da equação $f(x) = 0$, definindo a relação de recorrência a seguir, para uma escolha de $x_0$.\n\n$$x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_{k})}, \\quad k = 1, 2, \\ldots,$$\n### Critérios de erro\nAlgumas medidas de erro que podem ser utilizadas como critério de parada para o Método de Newton.\n- $|x_{k+1} - x_k| \u003c \\epsilon$. Esse critério pode não ser adequado quando a sequência converge lentamente.\n- $\\frac{|x_{k+1} - x_k|}{|x_{k+1}|} \u003c \\epsilon$. Interessante quando $x_{k+1}$ é muito pequeno (mas não nulo), ou muito grande.\n- $|f(x_{k+1})| \u003c \\epsilon$. Esse critério pode não ser adequado quando $f(x_k)$ possui valores pequenos.\n- $|f(x_{k+1})| + \\frac{|x_{k+1} - x_k|}{|x_{k+1}|} \u003c \\epsilon$. Compõe dois anteriores, é mais conservador.\n\n## Exemplos\n- Utilizando o método de Newton para encontrar um zero da função $f(x) = cos(x) - x$,  com aproximação inicial $x_0 = 0$. \n\t- Primeira iteração:\n\t\t- $x_0 = 0$.\n\t\t- $x_1 = x_0 - f(x_0)/f'(x_0) = 0 - (cos(0) - 0)/(-sin(0) - 1) = 1$.\n\t\t- $erro = \\frac{|x_1 - x_0|}{|x_1|} = 1.$\n\t- Segunda iteração:\n\t\t- $x_1 = 1$.\n\t\t- $x_2 = x_1 - f(x_1)/f'(x_1) = 1 - (-0.4597)/(-1.841) = 0.7503$.\n\t\t- $erro = \\frac{|0.7503 - 1|}{|0.7503|} = 0.3328$.\n\t- Terceira iteração:\n\t\t- $x_2 = 0.7503$.\n\t\t- $x_3 = x_2 - f(x_2)/f'(x_2) = 0.7503 - (-0.01882)/(-1.682) = 0.7391$.\n\t\t- $erro = \\frac{|0.7391 - 0.7503|}{|0.7391|} = 0.01515$.\n\n- Como um outro exemplo, considere a função $f(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. A relação de recorrência do método de Newton para essa função é dada por $$x_{k+1} = x_k - \\frac{x^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{\\frac{1}{3}x^{-\\frac{2}{3}}} = -2x_k.$$ Portanto, independente de qual aproximação inicial (não nula) for utilizada, a sequência gerada será divergente. Por exemplo, $x_0 = 1$ a sequência gerada seria $(1, -2, 4, -8, 16, -32, \\ldots).$  Isso mostra que a sequência gerada pelo método de Newton não possui garantia de convergência. \n\n- Considere a equação polinomial $x^3 - 2x + 2 = 0$, ao se tentar encontrar uma raiz da equação utilizando o método de Newton, com $x_0 = 0$. Observe o que ocorre.\n\t- $x_{1} = x_0 - \\frac{x_0^3 - 2x_0 + 2}{3x_0^2 - 2} = 0 - \\frac{2}{-2} = 1$\n\t- $x_2 = x_1 - \\frac{x_1^3 - 2x_1 +2}{3x_1^2-2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1} = 0$\n\t- $x_3 = 1, x_4 =0, \\ldots,$ sem nunca convergir.\n\t- graficamente, tem-se o seguinte: \u003ciframe src=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/epndu9typm?embed\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" style=\"border: 1px solid #ccc\" frameborder=0\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\t- Note que esse exemplo é apenas para ilustrar uma situação possível de oscilação entre os valores. Na prática, é possível encontrar uma raiz de polinômios cúbicas utilizando o [método de Cardano-Tartaglia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_c%C3%BAbica). Aliás, a solução de equações cúbicas está relacionada a uma novela matemática e à invenção de números imaginárias ([saiba mais](https://youtu.be/cUzklzVXJwo)).  \n\n\nOs exemplos anteriores lançam uma dúvida sobre o método. Afinal, o método de Newton é confiável? Será que ele é eficiente comparado ao [[Método da bipartição]] ou o [[Método da falsa-posição]]? Exploraremos tais aspectos a seguir.\n\n## Considerações sobre a convergência\n\nVimos no exemplo da função $f(x) = x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ que não há garantia de convergência da sequência gerada pelo método de Newton. Outra pergunta importante é: no caso de convergência da sequência, essa convergência é necessariamente para a raiz de $f(x) = 0$?\n\nSupondo que $x_{k},\\ k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$ converge para um valor final $\\alpha$, isto é,\n$$\n     \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k+1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty}x_{k} = \\alpha,\n$$\n\n aplicando esses limites na  expressão de recorrência, tem-se:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k+1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k} - \\lim_{k \\to \\infty}\n\\frac{f(x_{k})}{f'(x_{k})}, \n$$\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k+1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k} -\n\\frac{\\lim_{k \\to \\infty}f(x_{k})}{\\lim_{k \\to \\infty}f'(x_{k})}$$\n\nComo $f(x)$ e $f'(x)$ são contínuas, tem-se:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f(x_{k}) = f(\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k}) \n$$\ne $$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f'(x_{k}) = f'(\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k})\n$$\n  Então, \n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k+1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k} - \\frac{\\displaystyle f(\\lim_{k \\to\n    \\infty}x_{k})}{\\displaystyle f'(\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} x_{k})}.\n$$\nComo $\\displaystyle \\lim_{k \\to \\infty}x_{k+1} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty}x_{k} = \\alpha$, tem-se:\n\n$$\n\\alpha = \\alpha - \\frac{f(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)}\n$$\nPortanto, $\\frac{f(\\alpha)}{f'(\\alpha)} = 0$ e $f(\\alpha) = 0$, desde que $f'(\\alpha) \\neq 0$. Logo, $\\alpha$ é solução de $f(x) = 0$. \nAssim, se a sequência gerada pela equação de recorrência for convergente, o seu limite sempre será solução de $f(x) = 0$.\n\n## Considerações sobre a convergência\n\nA convergência do método de Newton é quadrática.\n\n## Método de Newton para raízes complexas\n\nConsidere o polinômio $P(x) = x^6 + 64$, que possui uma raiz complexa $x = 2i$. Para que o método de Newton consiga gerar uma sequência convergente para a raiz $x = 2i$, é necessário para que a aproximação inicial tenha uma componente imaginária $x_0 = a + bi, b \\neq 0$. \n\nPor exemplo, supondo $x_0 = i$, tem-se:\n$$x_1 = x_0 - \\frac{x_0^6 + 64}{6x_0^5} = 11.5i,$$\n$$x_2 = 9.58339i,$$\n$$x_3 = 7.98629i,$$\n$$x_4 = 6.5557i,$$\ne, assim por diante, até a convergência. Note que se $x_0 = 1+i$, o valor de convergência é $1.7321 - 1.0000i$, que também é uma das raízes de $P(x) = 0$.\n\nA convergência do método de Newton para as raízes de polinômios gera o chamado [Fractal de Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal). \n\u003ca href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"File:Julia set for the rational function.png\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png/800px-Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png?20111026001115\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png/1200px-Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png?20111026001115 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png/1600px-Julia_set_for_the_rational_function.png?20111026001115 2x\" data-file-width=\"2000\" data-file-height=\"1500\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n# Referências e outros materiais\n- Peters, Sérgio, e Julio Felipe Szeremeta.

Esses limitantes são expressões em funções de um parâmetro $t \\geq 2$, denominado de grau mínimo da árvore B. \n\t\u003e\u003e\u003e Cada nó com exceção da raiz possui pelo menos $t - 1$ chaves. Todo nó interno com exceção da raiz possui no mínimo $t$ filhos. \n\t\u003e\u003e\u003e Todo nó possui no máximo $2t-1$ chaves. Todo nó interno possui no máximo $2t$ filhos. \n\n- A árvore B mais simples possui $t=2$. Cada nó interno possui 2, 3 ou 4 filhos (ou seja, é uma 2-3-4 árvore).\n\n![[vault/attachments/ArvoreBexemplo.excalidraw|900]]\n\n\n- O número de acessos ao disco em uma Árvore B é proporcional a altura da árvore, para a maiora das operações\n\n- Teorema: \n\u003e Seja $n \\geq 1$, então para qualquer árvore B com $n$ chaves, altura $h$ e grau mínimo $t \\geq 2$ tem-se $$h \\leq log_t \\frac{n+1}{2}.$$ Ou seja, a altura é $O(log_t n)$ \n\n- Demonstração\n- A raiz da árvore contém pelo menos uma chave e todos os demais nós contém pelo menos $t-1$ chaves. Ou seja, existem pelos menos:\n\t - $2$ nós com profundidade $1$;\n\t - $2t$ nós com profundidade $2$;\n\t - $2t^2$ nós com profundidade 3;\n\t - ...\n\t - $2t^{(h-1)}$ nós com profundidade $h$.\n - Ou seja, o número de nós $n$ satisfaz $$n \\geq 1 + (t-1)\\sum_{i=1}^h (2t^{(i-1)}) = 1 + 2(t-1)\\frac{(t^h-1)}{t-1}.$$ Portanto $n \\geq 2t^h - 1$, resolvendo para $h$ tem-se a prova do teorema.\n\n## Operações elementares em uma árvore B\n\nPara os algoritmos a seguir é suposto:\n- node[i]: retorna a chave na posição $i$ presente em $node$. \n- node.n: retorna o número de elementos em $node$.\n- O método node.is_leaf() responde se $node$ é uma folha.\n- node.child[i]: returna a $i$-ésima subárvore enraizada em $node$.\n\n### Busca\n\nA busca em uma árvore B é análoga a uma busca em uma [[Árvores binárias de busca|Árvore binária de busca]]. Em cada nó, é necessário verificar qual a subárvore que potencialmente contém o elemento de interesse.\n\n```\nfind(key, node):\n\ti = 0\n\twhile i \u003c node.n and key \u003e node[i]:\n\t\ti = i + 1\n\tif i \u003c node.n and key == node[i]:\n\t\treturn node, i\n\telse if node.is_leaf():\n\t\treturn None\n\telse:\n\t\tfind(key, node.child[i])\t\n\t\n```\n\nA complexidade da busca é proporcional a altura da árvore, portanto $O(log_t \\ n)$. Note que, quanto maior o grau mínimo da árvore, $t$, menor o número de chamadas recursivas. Por quê? #pergunta\n\nDo ponto de vista de gerenciamento de arquivos. Suponha que foi utilizado uma estratégia de acesso indexado sequencial, mas o índice é grande o suficiente para não poder ser armazenado todo na memória principal. Como uma árvore B pode ser utilizada eficientemente nessa situação? #pergunta [[Organização de arquivos#Arquivo indexado sequencial]]\n\n### Inserção\n\nO processo de inserção é relativamente mais sofisticado do que no caso de [[Árvores binárias]]. Inicialmente, se busca pela folha onde será realizada a inserção. No entanto, não se pode simplesmente criar um novo nó para inserir o elemento, pois isso implicaria em uma violação das propriedades definidores de uma árvore B. Qual propriedade? #pergunta \n\nNesse caso, o objetivo é inserir o elemento no próprio nó folha, que pode estar cheio. Para lidar com tal situação, pode ser necessário realizar uma operação de particionamento do nó folha (*split*). \n\n#### Split\n\nUm nó que está cheio, possui $2t-1$ chaves. A operação de *split* é feita dividindo o nó cheio em dois $x$ e $y$ com $t-1$ chaves cada. O elemento com a chave mediana, $node[t-1]$, é \"promovido\" para o nó pai, identificando o ponto de divisão entre os elementos de $x$ e $y$. Contudo, caso o nó pai também esteja cheio, é necessário realizar o *split* antes de inserir. Ou seja, a operação de *split* pode gerar uma reação em cadeia, até a raiz da árvore. \n\nUtilize o simulador https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html:\n1. Escolha a opção Max. Degree = 4. Equivalente $t = 2$.\n2. Insira as chaves 10, 20 e 30, respectivamente. Note que uma nova inserção implica em um *overflow* da raiz. Ou seja, será necessária uma operação de *split*.\n3. Insira a chave 0. Note que o nó na posição $t-1 = 1$ foi promovido, marcando o ponto de separação entre as duas subárvores geradas. \n4. Insira as chaves 2, 3 e 40 respectivamente. Com uma inserção seguinte da chave 35, qual chave seria promovida e como ficariam os dois novos nós gerados? #pergunta \n5. Insira a chave 35.\n6. Insira a chave 4 e a 50, respectivamente. Qual o estado final da árvore se for inserida a chave 55? #pergunta\n7. Insira a chave 55. \n\n#check (Cormen, pg 493)\n\u003e As with a binary search tree, we can insert a key into a B-tree in a single pass down the tree from the root to a leaf. To do so, we do not wait to find out whether we will actually need to split a full node in order to do the insertion. Instead, as we travel down the tree searching for the position where the new key belongs, we split each full node we come to along the way (including the leaf itself). Thus whenever we want to split a full node y, we are assured that its parent is not full.\n\n### Remoção\n\nComo é possível remover elementos de nós internos, e não apenas de nós folha, a operação de remoção pode implicar na reorganização de alguns elementos da árvore. Suponha que a busca pelo elemento a ser removido começa no nós raiz $x$\n\n1. Se a chave $k$ está em $x$ e $x$ é um nó folha. Remova $k$ de $x$.\n2. Se a chave $k$ está em $x$ e $x$ é um nó interno $x$:\n\t1. Se o filho $y$ que precede $k$ no nó $x$ possui pelo menos $t$ chaves, encontre o predecessor $k'$ de $k$ na subárvore cuja raiz é $y$. Recursivamente remova $k'$ e substitua $k$ por $k'$ em $x$.\n\t2. Se $y$ possui menos de $t$ chaves, verifique se o filho $z$ que sucede $k$ em $x$. Se $z$ possuir pelo menos $t$ chaves, encontre o sucessor $k'$ de $k$ na subárvore cuja raiz é $z$. Recursivamente remova $k'$ e substitua $k$ por $k'$ em $x$.\n\t3. Caso ambos, $y$ e $z$, possuam $t-1$ chaves, faça uma junção (*merge*) de $z$  em $y$ ($k$ também é movido para $y$) e $y$ passa a conter $2t-1$ chaves. Então, destrua $z$ e recursivamente remove $k$ de $y$.\n3. Se a chave $k$ não está presente em $x$ e $x$ é um nó interno $x$: Determine a raiz $x.c_i$ da subárvore que (potencialmente) contém $k$. Se $x.c_i$ possui apenas $t-1$ chaves, execute um dos passos a seguir para garantir que a busca continua em um nó com pelo menos $t$ chaves. Então, continue recursivamente do filho apropriado de $x$\n\t1. Se $x.c_i$ possui apenas $t-1$ chaves mas possui um irmão imediato com $t$ chaves, mova uma chave de $x$ para $x.c_i$, mova a chave do irmão imediato de $x.c_i$ para $x$.\n\t2. Se $x.c_i$ e ambos os seus irmãos possuem $t-1$ chaves, faça o *merge* de $x.c_i$ com um dos irmãos (movendo uma chave de $x$ para o novo nó). \n\nConsidere o exemplo a seguir de [[2009Cormen_IntroductionToAlgorithms|Cormen et al. (2009)]] para uma árvore com $t = 3$.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220715163554.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220715163604.png]]\n\nConsidere uma árvore com $n$ elementos. Em que tipo de nó (folha ou interno), o ocorre o maior número de remoções? #pergunta\n\n## Árvores B e gerenciamento de arquivos\n\nUma das motivações primordiais da proposição da estrutura de dados Árvore B é no contexto de gerencia de arquivos com acesso indexado sequencial. Nesse estratégia, é criado um índice auxiliar com a posição das chaves dos registros que estão armazenados em memória secundária. Quando o índice auxiliar pode ser armazenado completamente em memória primária, há um grande ganho de eficiência na operação de busca, em relação a ter que buscar em um arquivo em memória secundária. Por outro lado, pode não ser possível armazenar todo o índice em memória primária. Nessa situação, pode ser interessante armazenar o índice em uma estrutura de Árvore B. \n\nUma vantagem de se utilizar árvore B nesse caso é a possibilidade de armazenar os nós mais altos da árvore na memória principal, minimizando o número de requisições à memória secundária. Além disso, durante a busca, se for necessário carregar novos dados em memória, isso é feito lendo um bloco de informações (e não apenas um único valor, como seria no caso de outras [[Árvores binárias]]).\n\nUma desvantagem dessa estratégia é a de que são armazenadas, em cada nó, referências para cada valor na memória secundária, além do valor em si (os registros propriamente ditos). Isso reduz consideravelmente o número de chaves que pode ser armazenadas na memória principal, aumentando o número de acessos à memória secundária. Para reduzir essa desvantagem, podem ser utilizadas [[Árvores B+]].\n\n\n## Comparações com outras formas de organização de índices\n\nDe acordo com o artigo original [[Árvores B#^bf7c66]], algumas vantagens de se utilizar Árvores B são:\n- Não há degradação de performance se a taxa de ocupação do dispositivo de armazenamento for alta\n- A ordem natural das chaves é mantida.\n\t- Permite processamentos de busca por predecessores, sucessores, busca por registros iniciando com em uma chave definida etc\n- Se buscas, inserções e remoções forem feitas em batches, o processamento é muito eficiente, essencialmente processando o arquivo sequencialmente. Desde que seja feita uma ordenação das requisições pela chave.\n\n# Referências\n- INE 5408 - Estruturas de Dados - Aulas 6.6 e 6.7 - Árvores-B, conceitos, algoritmos \u0026 exemplos. https://youtu.be/zkVGGbmjTH4\n- Bayer, Rudolf, and Edward McCreight. \"Organization and maintenance of large ordered indexes.\" Software pioneers.

Por exemplo a sequência $(s_1, s_2, \\ldots, s_n)$ definida de acordo com $$s_n = s_{n-1} + s_{n-2}.$$ A fórmula define que o $n$-ésimo termo da sequência é dado pela soma dos dois anteriores. Portanto, os termos da sequência são definidos a partir deles mesmos. Note que não é apenas uma sequência que é definida a partir da fórmula. \n\t\t- Quais são exemplos de sequências que são definidas pelas fórmula apresentada #pergunta \n\t\t\t- Tipicamente, se utiliza $s_1 = s_2 = 1$, o que define a [[Sequência de Fibonacci]].\n\n## Alguns exemplos\n- A [[Sequência de Fibonacci]] pode ser entendida como uma função definida da seguinte forma. $$F(n) = \\begin{cases}1, \u0026 n = 1, \\\\ 1, \u0026 n = 2,\\\\ F(n-1) + F(n-2), \u0026 n \\geq 3.\\end{cases}$$\n\t- Note a existência de dois tipos de expressão:\n\t\t- Casos-base: Casos em que o resultado pode ser obtido de forma trivial ($n=1$ e $n=2$).\n\t\t- Casos recursivos: Casos em que há dependência de instâncias menores (mais simples) da própria função $(n \\geq 3)$.\n\t\t- Em uma definição recursiva, é necessário ter pelo menos um caso-base? #pergunta \n\n```python\n def fib(n):\n    if n == 1 or n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n```\n\n- Outra função intrinsicamente recursiva é a fatorial de um número positivo $n$. $$n! = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\ldots \\cdot n.$$ No entanto, não há uma dependência explícita da própria função fatorial. Para expressá-la de forma recursiva é necessário observar que $n! = (n-1)! \\cdot n$. Com isso, tem-se: $$n! = \\begin{cases} 1, \u0026 n = 1, \\\\ (n-1)! \\cdot n \u0026 n \\geq 2. \\end{cases}$$\n\t- Qual o caso-base e qual o caso recursivo da função fatorial? #pergunta \n\n```python\ndef fat(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fat(n-1)*n\n```\n\n- De forma similar, o problema de se calcular a soma dos $n$ primeiros números positivos pode ser formulado de forma recursiva. Uma função que representa a solução do problema é $$S(n) = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + n.$$ Novamente, não é direta a definição recursiva de $S$. É necessário notar que $$S(n) = S(n-1) + n.$$\n\t- Para esse problema, como pode ser escrita a função recursiva? Identificando o caso-base e o caso recursivo #pergunta \n\n## Desenvolvendo uma solução recursiva*\n\nO desenvolvimento de soluções recursivas para um problema depende da definição do(s) caso(s)-base e do(s) caso(s) recursivos. Em geral, o primeiro passo é definir casos-base e o maior desafio está em descrever os casos recursivos. Para isso, é necessário entender dois conceitos importantes:\n1. Decomposição do problema\n2. Indução\n\n### Decomposição de um problema\n\nA decomposição é um conceito importante não apenas no conceito de recursão. Trata-se da ideia de quebrar problemas complexos em problemas menores (mais simples) que sejam mais fáceis de expressar, computar ou resolver. No contexto de recursão, a decomposição de um problema consiste em quebrá-lo em subproblemas, alguns similares ao original. Com isso, a solução do problema original passa a consistir em resolver e combinar as soluções do subproblemas. É importante observar que a decomposição em subproblemas deve aproximar o problema original do(s) caso(s) base. \n\n- Considere o problema de encontrar a soma dos $n$ primeiros números positivos: $S(n) = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + n$. Enquanto o caso base é $S(1) = 1$, é possível decompor o problema de diversas formas para definir os casos recursivas. \n\t- Uma possibilidade é reduzir $n$ em apenas uma unidade. Nesse caso, o objetivo seria definir $S(n)$ em função de $S(n-1)$. \n\t\t- Qual seria uma outra possibilidade? #desafio\n\n- Considere o problema de computar a soma dos elementos em uma lista $L = [a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}]$, $S(L) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i$\n\t- O problema pode ser decomposto diminuindo o seu tamanho em uma unidade $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ S(L[0:n-1]) + a_{n-1}, \u0026 n \u003e 0.\\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual é o caso-base e o caso recursivo do exemplo acima? #pergunta \n\t- Uma opção, que também diminui o problema em uma unidade é $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ a_0 + S(L[1:n]), \u0026 n \u003e 0.\\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual é o caso-base e o caso recursivo do exemplo acima? #pergunta\n\t- Também é possível separar o problema ao meio $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ a_0, \u0026 n = 1, \\\\ S(L[0:n//2]) + S(L[n//2:n]), \u0026 n \u003e 1.\\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual(is) o(s) caso(s)-base e o(s) caso(s) recursivo(s) do exemplo acima? #pergunta \n\t- Os códigos a seguir implementam cada uma das alternativas, respectivamente.\n\t\n```python\ndef sum_first1(L):\n\tn = len(L)\n\tif n == 0:\n\t\treturn 0\n\telse:\n\t\treturn sum_first1(L[0:n-1]) + L[n-1]\n\ndef sum_first2(L):\t\n    if len(L) == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return L[0] + sum_first2(L[1:])\n\ndef sum_first3(L):\n    n = len(L)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return L[0]\n    else:\n        return sum_first3(L[0:n//2]) + sum_first3(L[n//2:])\n```\n\n### Indução\n\nO termo *indução* é relacionado a provas matemáticas por indução. A ideia principal é que, ao se desenvolver uma solução recursiva, deve-se assumir que o código recursivo já funciona para instâncias menores (mais simples) do problema que se deseja resolver (mesmo que ele ainda não esteja implementado). \n\nUma prova por indução é composta por duas partes:\n1. O caso-base. Verificar que a fórmula é válida para o menor caso possível $n_0$.\n2. O passo indutivo. Assumir que a fórmula é verdadeira para um valor genértico $n$ (hipótese indutiva). Em seguida, usando a hipótese indutiva, mostrar que a fórmula também é válida para $n+1$. \n\nSe for possível mostrar os dois passos, então se diz que a fórmula é válida para qualquer $n \\geq n_0$.\n\n#### Exemplo de prova por indução\n\nConsidere a seguinte afirmação. A soma dos $n$ primeiros números positivos $S(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} i$   pode ser calculada com a seguinte fórmula $$S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$\n1. Caso-base. Para mostrar o caso-base basta verificar que para $n=1$ tem-se $$1 = S(1) = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2}.$$\n2. Para mostrar o passo indutivo é necessário mostrar que $$S(n+1) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2},$$ assumindo que $$S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$é verdadeira. Para isso, note que $$S(n+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1).$$ Mas $\\sum_{i=1}^n i = S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Então, $$S(n+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n + 1 = \\frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}.$$\nO passo indutivo na prova costuma ser mais complicado, assim como o caso recursivo em um algoritmo recursivo. Quais as semelhanças entre os passos da prova por indução e o desenvolvimento de uma solução recursiva (como as que foram realizadas anteriormente)? #pergunta \n\n\n## Programação imperativa e programação declarativa\n\nOs paradigmas de programação são estratégias gerais para o desenvolvimento de software.\n\n- A programação imperativa se concentrar em definir como os programas funcionam, com o código descrevendo examente o fluxo de execução das instruções e o estado do programa. Esse é o paradigma seguido por uma solução iterativa.\n- Uma solução recursiva segue o paradigma declarativo, que se concentrar em definir o que um programa deveria realizar. A programação funcional segue esse conceito.\n\n## Exemplos de problemas\n- [[Torre de Hanoi]]\n- [[Exponenciação melhorada]]\n\n# Referências\n- [[2017Sanchez_IntroductionRecursiveProgramming|Introduction to recursive programming.

Em um desses pinos, na criação, Deus colocou 64 discos de puro ouro, o maior disco repousando na placa de bronze, e os seguintes, um menor que o anterior, repousando um em cima do outro. Essa é a Torre de Brama. Dia e noite, sem descanso, monges transferem os discos de diamante de um pino para o outro de acordo com as leis imutáveis de Bramah. Essas leis permitem apenas o movimento de um disco por vez e que este disco só possa ser posto em um pino de forma que não haja disco menor sob ele. Quando os 64 discos tiverem sido transferidos do pino original para um dos demais, torre, templo e o mundo se tornará pó, e, com um trovão, desaparecerá.(Tradução livre de Hinz, Andreas M., et al.
