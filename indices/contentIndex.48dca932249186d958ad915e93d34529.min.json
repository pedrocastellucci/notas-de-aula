You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'مدونتي'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-30T21:40:38.164507435Z","tags":null},"/notes/custom-Domain":{"title":"Custom Domain","content":"\n### Registrar\nThis step is only applicable if you are using a **custom domain**! If you are using a `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io` domain, you can skip this step.\n\nFor this last bit to take effect, you also need to create a CNAME record with the DNS provider you register your domain with (i.e. NameCheap, Google Domains).\n\nGitHub has some [documentation on this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site), but the tldr; is to\n\n1.

You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.**\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that **all links should be relative to the root `/content` path**. \n\n```markdown\nFor example, I want to link this current document to `notes/config.md`.\n[A link to the config page](notes/config.md)\n```\n\nSimilarly, you can put local images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\nYou can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\n\n### Front Matter\nHugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files. Make sure that your title is double-quoted and that you have a title defined at the top of your file like so. You can also add tags here as well.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Example Title\"\ntags:\n- example-tag\n---\n\nRest of your content here...\n```\n\n### Obsidian\nI recommend using [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md/) as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n\u003e 🔗 Step 3: [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n## Previewing Changes\nThis step is purely optional and mostly for those who want to see the published version of their digital garden locally before opening it up to the internet.

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from running automatically on Forked Repostories. Head to the 'Actions' tab of your forked repository and Enable Workflows to setup deploying your Quartz site!\n\n![Enable GitHub Actions](notes/images/github-actions.png)*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz!

If you are unfamiliar, [this resource](https://resources.nwplus.io/2-beginner/how-to-git-github.html) is a great place to start!\n\n### Forking\n\u003e A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n\nNavigate to the GitHub repository for the Quartz project:\n\n📁 [Quartz Repository](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n\nThen, Fork the repository into your own GitHub account. If you don't have an account, you can make on for free [here](https://github.com/join). More details about forking a repo can be found on [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).\n\n### Cloning\nAfter you've made a fork of the repository, you need to download the files locally onto your machine. Ensure you have `git`, then type the following command replacing `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quartz\n```\n\n## Editing\nGreat!

Here are a list of common questions and problems people encounter when installing Quartz.\n\nWhile you're here, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/cRFFHYye7t) :)\n\n### Does Quartz have Latex support?\nYes! See [CJK + Latex Support (测试)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(测试).md) for a brief demo.\n\n### Can I use \\\u003cObsidian Plugin\\\u003e in Quartz?\nUnless it produces direct Markdown output in the file, no. There currently is no way to bundle plugin code with Quartz.\n\nThe easiest way would be to add your own HTML partial that supports the functionality you are looking for.\n\n### My GitHub pages is just showing the README and not Quartz\nMake sure you set the source to deploy from `master` (and not `hugo`) using `/ (root)`! See more in the [hosting](/notes/hosting) guide\n\n### Some of my pages have 'January 1, 0001' as the last modified date\nThis is a problem caused by `git` treating files as case-insensitive by default and some of your posts probably have capitalized file names. You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup Google Analytics?\nYou can edit it in `config.toml` and either use a V3 (UA-) or V4 (G-) tag.\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide.

Todo nó interno com exceção da raiz possui no mínimo $t$ filhos. \n\t\u003e\u003e\u003e Todo nó possui no máximo $2t-1$ chaves. Todo nó interno possui no máximo $2t$ filhos. \n\n- A árvore B mais simples possui $t=2$. Cada nó interno possui 2, 3 ou 4 filhos (ou seja, é uma 2-3-4 árvore).\n\n![[vault/attachments/ArvoreBexemplo.excalidraw|900]]\n\n\n- O número de acessos ao disco em uma Árvore B é proporcional a altura da árvore, para a maiora das operações\n\n- Teorema: \n\u003e Seja $n \\geq 1$, então para qualquer árvore B com $n$ chaves, altura $h$ e grau mínimo $t \\geq 2$ tem-se $$h \\leq log_t \\frac{n+1}{2}.$$ Ou seja, a altura é $O(log_t n)$ \n\n- Demonstração\n- A raiz da árvore contém pelo menos uma chave e todos os demais nós contém pelo menos $t-1$ chaves. Ou seja, existem pelos menos:\n\t - $2$ nós com profundidade $1$;\n\t - $2t$ nós com profundidade $2$;\n\t - $2t^2$ nós com profundidade 3;\n\t - ...\n\t - $2t^{(h-1)}$ nós com profundidade $h$.\n - Ou seja, o número de nós $n$ satisfaz $$n \\geq 1 + (t-1)\\sum_{i=1}^h (2t^{(i-1)}) = 1 + 2(t-1)\\frac{(t^h-1)}{t-1}.$$ Portanto $n \\geq 2t^h - 1$, resolvendo para $h$ tem-se a prova do teorema.\n\n## Operações elementares em uma árvore B\n\nPara os algoritmos a seguir é suposto:\n- node[i]: retorna a chave na posição $i$ presente em $node$. \n- node.n: retorna o número de elementos em $node$.\n- O método node.is_leaf() responde se $node$ é uma folha.\n- node.child[i]: returna a $i$-ésima subárvore enraizada em $node$.\n\n### Busca\n\nA busca em uma árvore B é análoga a uma busca em uma [[Árvores binárias de busca|Árvore binária de busca]]. Em cada nó, é necessário verificar qual a subárvore que potencialmente contém o elemento de interesse.\n\n```\nfind(key, node):\n\ti = 0\n\twhile i \u003c node.n and key \u003e node[i]:\n\t\ti = i + 1\n\tif i \u003c node.n and key == node[i]:\n\t\treturn node, i\n\telse if node.is_leaf():\n\t\treturn None\n\telse:\n\t\tfind(key, node.child[i])\t\n\t\n```\n\nA complexidade da busca é proporcional a altura da árvore, portanto $O(log_t \\ n)$. Note que, quanto maior o grau mínimo da árvore, $t$, menor o número de chamadas recursivas. Por quê? #pergunta\n\nDo ponto de vista de gerenciamento de arquivos. Suponha que foi utilizado uma estratégia de acesso indexado sequencial, mas o índice é grande o suficiente para não poder ser armazenado todo na memória principal. Como uma árvore B pode ser utilizada eficientemente nessa situação? #pergunta [[Organização de arquivos#Arquivo indexado sequencial]]\n\n### Inserção\n\nO processo de inserção é relativamente mais sofisticado do que no caso de [[Árvores binárias]]. Inicialmente, se busca pela folha onde será realizada a inserção. No entanto, não se pode simplesmente criar um novo nó para inserir o elemento, pois isso implicaria em uma violação das propriedades definidores de uma árvore B. Qual propriedade? #pergunta \n\nNesse caso, o objetivo é inserir o elemento no próprio nó folha, que pode estar cheio. Para lidar com tal situação, pode ser necessário realizar uma operação de particionamento do nó folha (*split*). \n\n#### Split\n\nUm nó que está cheio, possui $2t-1$ chaves. A operação de *split* é feita dividindo o nó cheio em dois $x$ e $y$ com $t-1$ chaves cada. O elemento com a chave mediana, $node[t-1]$, é \"promovido\" para o nó pai, identificando o ponto de divisão entre os elementos de $x$ e $y$. Contudo, caso o nó pai também esteja cheio, é necessário realizar o *split* antes de inserir. Ou seja, a operação de *split* pode gerar uma reação em cadeia, até a raiz da árvore. \n\nUtilize o simulador https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BTree.html:\n1. Escolha a opção Max. Degree = 4. Equivalente $t = 2$.\n2. Insira as chaves 10, 20 e 30, respectivamente. Note que uma nova inserção implica em um *overflow* da raiz. Ou seja, será necessária uma operação de *split*.\n3. Insira a chave 0. Note que o nó na posição $t-1 = 1$ foi promovido, marcando o ponto de separação entre as duas subárvores geradas. \n4. Insira as chaves 2, 3 e 40 respectivamente. Com uma inserção seguinte da chave 35, qual chave seria promovida e como ficariam os dois novos nós gerados? #pergunta \n5. Insira a chave 35.\n6. Insira a chave 4 e a 50, respectivamente. Qual o estado final da árvore se for inserida a chave 55? #pergunta\n7. Insira a chave 55. \n\n#check (Cormen, pg 493)\n\u003e As with a binary search tree, we can insert a key into a B-tree in a single pass down the tree from the root to a leaf. To do so, we do not wait to find out whether we will actually need to split a full node in order to do the insertion. Instead, as we travel down the tree searching for the position where the new key belongs, we split each full node we come to along the way (including the leaf itself). Thus whenever we want to split a full node y, we are assured that its parent is not full.\n\n### Remoção\n\nComo é possível remover elementos de nós internos, e não apenas de nós folha, a operação de remoção pode implicar na reorganização de alguns elementos da árvore. Suponha que a busca pelo elemento a ser removido começa no nós raiz $x$\n\n1. Se a chave $k$ está em $x$ e $x$ é um nó folha. Remova $k$ de $x$.\n2. Se a chave $k$ está em $x$ e $x$ é um nó interno $x$:\n\t1. Se o filho $y$ que precede $k$ no nó $x$ possui pelo menos $t$ chaves, encontre o predecessor $k'$ de $k$ na subárvore cuja raiz é $y$. Recursivamente remova $k'$ e substitua $k$ por $k'$ em $x$.\n\t2. Se $y$ possui menos de $t$ chaves, verifique se o filho $z$ que sucede $k$ em $x$. Se $z$ possuir pelo menos $t$ chaves, encontre o sucessor $k'$ de $k$ na subárvore cuja raiz é $z$. Recursivamente remova $k'$ e substitua $k$ por $k'$ em $x$.\n\t3. Caso ambos, $y$ e $z$, possuam $t-1$ chaves, faça uma junção (*merge*) de $z$  em $y$ ($k$ também é movido para $y$) e $y$ passa a conter $2t-1$ chaves. Então, destrua $z$ e recursivamente remove $k$ de $y$.\n3. Se a chave $k$ não está presente em $x$ e $x$ é um nó interno $x$: Determine a raiz $x.c_i$ da subárvore que (potencialmente) contém $k$. Se $x.c_i$ possui apenas $t-1$ chaves, execute um dos passos a seguir para garantir que a busca continua em um nó com pelo menos $t$ chaves. Então, continue recursivamente do filho apropriado de $x$\n\t1. Se $x.c_i$ possui apenas $t-1$ chaves mas possui um irmão imediato com $t$ chaves, mova uma chave de $x$ para $x.c_i$, mova a chave do irmão imediato de $x.c_i$ para $x$.\n\t2. Se $x.c_i$ e ambos os seus irmãos possuem $t-1$ chaves, faça o *merge* de $x.c_i$ com um dos irmãos (movendo uma chave de $x$ para o novo nó). \n\nConsidere o exemplo a seguir de [[2009Cormen_IntroductionToAlgorithms|Cormen et al. (2009)]] para uma árvore com $t = 3$.\n\n![[Pasted image 20220715163554.png]]\n\n![[Pasted image 20220715163604.png]]\n\nConsidere uma árvore com $n$ elementos. Em que tipo de nó (folha ou interno), o ocorre o maior número de remoções? #pergunta\n\n## Árvores B e gerenciamento de arquivos\n\nUma das motivações primordiais da proposição da estrutura de dados Árvore B é no contexto de gerencia de arquivos com acesso indexado sequencial. Nesse estratégia, é criado um índice auxiliar com a posição das chaves dos registros que estão armazenados em memória secundária. Quando o índice auxiliar pode ser armazenado completamente em memória primária, há um grande ganho de eficiência na operação de busca, em relação a ter que buscar em um arquivo em memória secundária. Por outro lado, pode não ser possível armazenar todo o índice em memória primária. Nessa situação, pode ser interessante armazenar o índice em uma estrutura de Árvore B. \n\nUma vantagem de se utilizar árvore B nesse caso é a possibilidade de armazenar os nós mais altos da árvore na memória principal, minimizando o número de requisições à memória secundária. Além disso, durante a busca, se for necessário carregar novos dados em memória, isso é feito lendo um bloco de informações (e não apenas um único valor, como seria no caso de outras [[Árvores binárias]]).\n\nUma desvantagem dessa estratégia é a de que são armazenadas, em cada nó, referências para cada valor na memória secundária, além do valor em si (os registros propriamente ditos). Isso reduz consideravelmente o número de chaves que pode ser armazenadas na memória principal, aumentando o número de acessos à memória secundária. Para reduzir essa desvantagem, podem ser utilizadas [[Árvores B+]].\n\n\n## Comparações com outras formas de organização de índices\n\nDe acordo com o artigo original [[Árvores B#^bf7c66]], algumas vantagens de se utilizar Árvores B são:\n- Não há degradação de performance se a taxa de ocupação do dispositivo de armazenamento for alta\n- A ordem natural das chaves é mantida.\n\t- Permite processamentos de busca por predecessores, sucessores, busca por registros iniciando com em uma chave definida etc\n- Se buscas, inserções e remoções forem feitas em batches, o processamento é muito eficiente, essencialmente processando o arquivo sequencialmente. Desde que seja feita uma ordenação das requisições pela chave.\n\n# Referências\n- INE 5408 - Estruturas de Dados - Aulas 6.6 e 6.7 - Árvores-B, conceitos, algoritmos \u0026 exemplos. https://youtu.be/zkVGGbmjTH4\n- Bayer, Rudolf, and Edward McCreight. \"Organization and maintenance of large ordered indexes.\" Software pioneers.

Outro caso importante é a análise de caso médio, isto é, em determinar, na média, qual a complexidade do algoritmo. Essa análise pode ser bastante sofisiticada e, em geral, está fora do escopo deste material.\n\n## Algumas classes de complexidade\n\n### Ordem de complexidade linear, $O(n)$\n\n```\nfunction busca(x, v):\n\ti = 0\n\twhile i \u003c n:\n\t\tif x == v[i]\n\t\t\treturn True\n\t\ti = i + 1\n\treturn False\n```\n\n### Ordem de complexidade quadrática, $O(n^2)$\nSupondo que as listas $va$ e $vb$ possuem $n$ elementos.\n\n```\nfunction busca(va, vb):\n\tfor x in va:\n\t\tfor y in vb:\n\t\t\tif x == y:\n\t\t\t\treturn True\n\treturn False\n```\n\n### Ordem de complexidade logarítimica, $O(log\\ n)$\n\nQuantas vezes é necessário dividir um número positivo $n \u003e 0$ pela metade para chegar à unidade?\n\n```\nfunction divisoes(n):\n\ti = 0\n\twhile n != 1:\n\t\tn = n//2\n\t\ti = i+1\n\treturn i\n```\n\n### Comparação entre classes\n\nOs gráficos a seguir apresentam uma comparação visual entre as classes.

É necessário notar que $$S(n) = S(n-1) + n.$$\n\t- Para esse problema, como pode ser escrita a função recursiva? Identificando o caso-base e o caso recursivo #pergunta \n\n## Desenvolvendo uma solução recursiva\n\nO desenvolvimento de solluções recursivas para um problema depende da definição do(s) caso(s)-base e do(s) caso(s) recursivos. Em geral, o primeiro passo é definir casos-base e o maior desafio está em descrever os casos recursivos. Para isso, é necessário entender dois conceitos importantes:\n1. Decomposição do problema\n2. Indução\n\n### Decomposição de um problema\n\nA decomposição é um conceito importante não apenas no conceito de recursão. Trata-se da ideia de quebrar problemas complexos em problemas menores (mais simples) que sejam mais fáceis de expressar, computar ou resolver. No contexto de recursão, a decomposição de um problema consiste em quebrá-lo em subproblemas, alguns similares ao original. Com isso, a solução do problema original passa a consistir em resolver e combinar as soluções do subproblemas. É importante observar que a decomposição em subproblemas deve aproximar o problema original do(s) caso(s) base. \n\n- Considere o problema de encontrar a soma dos $n$ primeiros números positivos: $S(n) = 1 + 2 + \\ldots + n$. Enquanto o caso base é $S(1) = 1$, é possível decompor o problema de diversas formas para definir os casos recursivas. \n\t- Uma possibilidade é reduzir $n$ em apenas uma unidade. Nesse caso, o objetivo seria definir $S(n)$ em função de $S(n-1)$. \n\t- Qual seria uma outra possibilidade? #pergunta \n\n- Considere o problema de computar a soma dos elementos em uma lista $L = [a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_{n-1}]$, $S(L) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i$\n\t- O problema pode ser decomposto diminuindo o seu tamanho em uma unidade $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ S(L[0:n-1]) + a_{n-1}, \u0026 n \u003e 0.\\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual é o caso-base e o caso recursivo do exemplo acima? #pergunta \n\t- Uma opção, que também diminui o problema em uma unidade é $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ a_0 + S(L[1:n]), \u0026 n \u003e 0.\\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual é o caso-base e o caso recursivo do exemplo acima? #pergunta\n\t- Também é possível separar o problema ao meio $$S(L) = \\begin{cases}0, \u0026 n = 0,\\\\ a_0, \u0026 n = 1, \\\\ S(L[0:n//2]) + S(L[n//2:n]), \u0026 n \u003e 1.\\\\ \\end{cases}$$\n\t\t- Qual(is) o(s) caso(s)-base e o(s) caso(s) recursivo(s) do exemplo acima? #pergunta \n\t- Os códigos a seguir implementam cada uma das alternativas, respectivamente.\n\t\n```python\ndef sum_first1(L):\n\tn = len(L)\n\tif n == 0:\n\t\treturn 0\n\telse:\n\t\treturn sum_first1(L[0:n-1]) + L[n-1]\n\ndef sum_first2(L):\t\n    if len(L) == 0:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return L[0] + sum_first2(L[1:])\n\ndef sum_first3(L):\n    n = len(L)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return L[0]\n    else:\n        return sum_first3(L[0:n//2]) + sum_first3(L[n//2:])\n```\n\n\n\t\n### Indução\n\nO termo *indução* é relacionado a provas matemáticas por indução. A ideia principal é que, ao se desenvolver uma solução recursiva, deve-se assumir que o código recursiva já funciona para instâncias menores (mais simples) do problema que se deseja resolver (mesmo que ele ainda não esteja implementado). \n\nUma prova por indução é composta por duas partes:\n1. O caso-base. Verificar que a fórmula é válida para o menor caso possível $n_0$.\n2. O passo indutivo. Assumir que a fórmula é verdadeira para um valor genértico $n$ (hipótese indutiva). Em seguida, usando a hipótese indutiva, mostrar que a fórmula também é válida para $n+1$. \n\nSe for possível mostrar os dois passos, então se diz que a fórmula é válida para qualquer $n \\geq n_0$.\n\n#### Exemplo de prova por indução\n\nConsidere a seguinte afirmação. A soma dos $n$ primeiros números positivos $S(n) = \\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} i$   pode ser calculada com a seguinte fórmula $$S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$$\n1. Caso-base. Para mostrar o caso-base basta verificar que para $n=1$ tem-se $$1 = S(1) = \\frac{1(1+1)}{2}.$$\n2. Para mostrar o passo indutivo é necessário mostrar que $$S(n+1) = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2},$$ assumindo que $$S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$é verdadeira. Para isso, note que $$S(n+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1).$$ Mas $\\sum_{i=1}^n i = S(n) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. Então, $$S(n+1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n i + (n+1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + n + 1 = \\frac{n^2 + 3n + 2}{2} = \\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}.$$\nO passo indutivo na prova costuma ser mais complicado, assim como o caso recursivo em um algoritmo recursivo. Quais as semelhanças entre os passos da prova por indução e o desenvolvimento de uma solução recursiva (como as que foram realizadas anteriormente)? #pergunta \n\n\n## Programação imperativa e programação declarativa\n\nOs paradigmas de programação são estratégias gerais para o desenvolvimento de software.\n\n- A programação imperativa se concentrar em definir como os programas funcionam, com o código descrevendo examente o fluxo de execução das instruções e o estado do programa. Esse é o paradigma seguido por uma solução iterativa.\n- Uma solução recursiva segue o paradigma declarativo, que se concentrar em definir o que um programa deveria realizar. A programação funcional segue esse conceito.\n\n## Exemplos de problemas\n- [[Torre de Hanoi]]\n- [[Exponenciação melhorada]]\n\n# Referências\n- [[2017Sanchez_IntroductionRecursiveProgramming|Introduction to recursive programming.

Essa é a Torre de Brama. Dia e noite, sem descanso, monges transferem os discos de diamante de um pino para o outro de acordo com as leis imutáveis de Bramah. Essas leis permitem apenas o movimento de um disco por vez e que este disco só possa ser posto em um pino de forma que não haja disco menor sob ele.
