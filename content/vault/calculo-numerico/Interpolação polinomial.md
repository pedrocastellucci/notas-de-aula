> the art of reading between the lines in a numerical table (Thiele)


Toomer [318] believes that Hipparchus of Rhodes (190–120 BC)  
used linear interpolation in the construction of tables of the so-called “chord function” (re-  
lated to the sine function) for the purpose of computing the positions of celestial bodies.  
Later examples are found in the Almagest (“The Mathematical Compilation”, ca. 140 AD)  
of Claudius Ptolemy, the Egypt-born Greek astronomer-mathematician who propounded  
the geocentric view of the universe which prevailed until the 16th century. Apart from  
theory, this influential work also contains numerical tables of a wide variety of trigonomet-  
ric functions defined for astronomical purposes
